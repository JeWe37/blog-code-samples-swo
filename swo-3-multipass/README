Demonstrates multiple interleaved SWO stimulus outputs
* Uses the DAC to generate some different shaped waves, and dumps to trace
* Uses the ADC to sample that wave (XXX: do we need to wire this externally?)
  and dumps to trace
* Dumps some timing counts of interrupts to trace
  ** TODO - would be ideal to get the trace support far enough to turn on
     automatic timestamping.....
