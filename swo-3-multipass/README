Demonstrates multiple interleaved SWO stimulus outputs
* Requires a function generator or some signal source on PA1
* Runs the adc at 5khz to sample that, and dumps the value to ITM
* Dumps some timing counts of interrupts to trace

TODO:
* Uses the onboard DAC to generate some waves instead
* Demonstrate how to get automatic timestamping of trace output (DWT can do this)
