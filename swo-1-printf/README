* Uses SWO/SWV to provide a printf style console
* uses basic timer 6 with overflows to generate a 1ms counter (not an ideal
  use, but shows some api methods and can be demoed on the disco board)
* uses basic timer 7 with the exti interrupts to do ghetto input capture.
  Not as fast or precise as the real input capture modes, but can be used
  on any gpio pin.
